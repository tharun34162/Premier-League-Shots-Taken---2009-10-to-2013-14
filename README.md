Hi there, 

Please find attached the code I used to conduct the webscraping of WhoScored's match URLs to obtain the shots data I wanted. Please start from the jupyter notbook named "WhoScored Match-Centre Scraping (1) -  Collection of Match-URLs" and work your way through till "WhoScored Match-Centre Scraping (3) -  Cleaning the Shots Data". 

The final shots data for each of the following seasons of the Premier League has also been attached - 
2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13 & 2013/14.

Best Wishes,
Tharun
